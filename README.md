<sub>* This is currently an experimental phase where the primary focus is on making the system functional and establishing a practical and logical pathway that aligns with both my vision and the project's goals. It might contain errors, bugs, etc. Many other non-core elements of the project are considered secondary. Project in progress.</sub>
